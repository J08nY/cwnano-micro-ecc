## VM USB version

The VM needs to have USB 3.0 enabled for the ChipWhisperer communication
to work properly. Shutdown the VM, and change this in the settings.

## VM shared folder error

The VM complains about a shared folder "C:/test" not existing.
This can be ignored.

## VM device USB enable

The VM needs to be able to talk to the ChipWhisperer device.
Make sure that you enable "NewAE Technology Inc. ChipWhisperer Nano"
in the "Devices" -> "USB" settings. You may not see this option
unless you have the ChipWhisperer device physically connected.
